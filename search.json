For example, They most highest spenders are the age groups between age 18 to 40, this could help by encouraging brands to make clothes and other products of fashion that would interest these age groups. Another example could be that the classification of genders and spending scores, this could benefit by allowing brands to make more products that would interest the high spenders of that specific gender and possibly double the profit of those brands"
